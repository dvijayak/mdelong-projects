CIS*3090 Parallel Programming Term Project
"Where's Parallaldo" Cluster Programming with Charm++

Fall 2011

This document provides a brief overview of my application and 
what it is supposed to accomplish. A user guide is also added 
for clarity.

------------------------------
PROGRAM OVERVIEW
------------------------------
This application is designed to search for a set of templates 
(termed parallaldos) in a series of image files. Both the templates 
and the images I used to test my program will be uploaded in my final 
SVN submission.
Each file is expected to contain exactly one parallaldo match; thus, if 
a parallaldo is found within a file, there is no need to check for others.

When the search methods find a match, the application prints out the template 
file name, the image file name, the x,y coordinates of the top left corner of 
the template, and the rotation.
To illustrate, suppose the program finds a match for template sample1.txt in
image file target_11.img. The rotation of the template is 0 degrees. Output:

$sample1.txt target_11.img (65,124)

This program should be able to run on any system with the Charm++ library
installed, whether it is shared memory or cluster. However, please note that
image files are passed as messages, and some of this data can be quite large
(several MB). For this reason, the application will not work on hardware with
limited memory storage (e.g. the Cell processor).

Because the application was created primarily for comparison and
experimentation purposes, the error checking is by no means robust. I will add
further error checking in the future, time permitting.

------------------------------
USER GUIDE
------------------------------
To build the "Where's Parallaldo" application, you can use the Makefile
provided with the source code. Run "make clean" to remove the object files and
the executable generated by the Charm and C++ compilers.

To run the program in standalone mode, use the following command (for example
purposes, with 4 processors)):

./charmrun ./wp <template directory> <image directory> +p4

If you are running this application on a SHARCNET cluster, please run the
program using the scheduling queue. The command for this (again, using 4
processors) is:

sqsub -q mpi -n 4 [-r <time limit>] [-o logfile] ./wp <template dir> <image
dir>

Please note that you must supply the program a valid directory path for both
the template and image directories as shown in the example above. The program
will search these directories for templates and images respectively, and if
none are found or the directory is invalid, this application will terminate
with a printed error message.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As previously mentioned, the application should run on any computer system
with Charm++ installed and sufficient memory, thanks to the abstraction
provided by the Charm++ runtime system. Enjoy!
